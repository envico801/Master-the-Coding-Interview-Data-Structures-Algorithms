Q: What is the Big O of an Array push/append operation? (aka **insertion**: Array.push(value))  
A: O(1) if the array is static  
O(n) if the array is dynamic and has to grow when the new value is added.  
or if we are using other methods like (shift(), splice())  
**Note that the worst case is still O(n).**
