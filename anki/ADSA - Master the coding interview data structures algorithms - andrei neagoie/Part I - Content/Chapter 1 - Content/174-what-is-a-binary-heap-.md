Q: What is a binary heap?  
A: A binary heap is a binary tree with the following properties:  
1.It's a complete tree. All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which will have elements positioned as left as possible.  
2.It is either a Min Heap or a Max Heap.  
In a Min Heap the root element must be the smallest (or the one with the least importance) among all elements present in the tree.  
In a Max Heap the root element must be the largest (or the one with the higher importance) of all elements present in the tree.  
3.And have a max of 2 children (like a BT)
