Q: Why should we review the documentation of the (native) methods we are using?  
A: To understand how it works in the language, it can also serve as a reference and a guide.  
For example, in the case of javascript the implementation of the sort() method will vary depending on the environment where it is executed, ECMAScript says how it should look like (grab this argument and return this), but does not talk anything about the implementation.
