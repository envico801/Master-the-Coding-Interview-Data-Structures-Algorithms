Q: What can cause time in a function? **(how long does it take to traverse / solve something as the input grows, how many operations does it have to perform?)**
A: 1.Operations (+, -, \*, /)  
2.Comparisons (<, >, ==)  
3.Looping (for, while)  
4.Outside Function call (function()) (can be a call to a recursive function or to a regular function.)
