Q: What causes Space complexity? **(how much memory or resources it occupies as the input grows)**  
A: 1.Variables (assignments and mutability with objects)  
2.Data Structures (both custom and native)  
3.Function Call (function calls, e.g. a recursive one, which is stored in memory as a stack.)  
4.Allocations (when we create variables, functions or anything else that is stored in the memory)
