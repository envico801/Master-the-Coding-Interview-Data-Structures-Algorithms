Q: When shall we use recursion?
A: When it gets to complicated problems like traversing or searching through trees or graphs (DFS & BFS) recursion is really really useful and better than iterative aproaches
When we're sorting through items there's also cases that will see that recursion is preferred
e.g. (merge sort, quick sort)
