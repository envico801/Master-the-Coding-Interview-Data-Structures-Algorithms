Q: What does the rule of "eliminating constants" mean?
A: As the name says, if Big 0 is the product of multiple terms, constant terms are eliminated (constant terms are like static numbers, numbers like 1, 4, 5, basically anything that is not a variable).  
We only care about when it scales, when the size of the input is getting larger and larger.
