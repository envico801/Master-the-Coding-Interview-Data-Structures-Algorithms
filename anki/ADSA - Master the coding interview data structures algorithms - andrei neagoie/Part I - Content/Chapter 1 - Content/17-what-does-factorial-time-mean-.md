Q: What does factorial time mean?  
A: It means that the number of operations will be proportional to the factorial of the input.  
**We will find ourselves writing algorithms with factorial time complexity when calculating permutations and combinations.**  
Factorial is the multiplication of all positive integer numbers less than itself. For instance:  
The factorial of 5, or _5!_, is:
```text
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
```
