Q: Sort algorithm question  
Which algorithm would you use for the following context?  
**Sport scores on ESPN**  
A: Quick sort  
Sports scores on ESPN sports scores can vary. There's decimal places sometimes there's there's different formats such as tennis and soccer and different things and there's definitely lots of sports and lots of scores to handle. It's going to be the most efficient and although we might have the worst case I doubt that the scores are going to be sorted because there are just so many different kinds. But I'm also worried about in-memory sorting. So if I used merge sort it might be a little too much for this because of our increase space complexity  
versus quicksort which if you remember has better space complexity.
