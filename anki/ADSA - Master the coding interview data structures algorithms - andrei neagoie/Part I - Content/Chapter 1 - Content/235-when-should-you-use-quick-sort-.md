Q: When should you use quick sort?
A: Quicksort is superior to merge sort in terms of average case time complexity and space complexity. It has comparable speed to merge sort, but with lower space requirements. Quicksort is considered one of the most popular sorting algorithms.  
However, a drawback of Quicksort is its worst case scenario, where if the pivot is not chosen properly, the sorting process can become significantly slower. Therefore, it is important to exercise caution when using Quicksort, particularly if worst case scenarios are a concern. In such cases, it may be advisable to choose a different sorting algorithm.
