Q: What is the main difference between a Linked List and an Array?  
A: Arrays are indexed, Linked Lists are not.  
If you want to access the 5th element in a Linked List, you have to start from the beginning of the list and traverse to the 5th element.  
In an Array, you can simply access the element at index 4 ( arr\[4\] ) to get the value of the 5th element.
