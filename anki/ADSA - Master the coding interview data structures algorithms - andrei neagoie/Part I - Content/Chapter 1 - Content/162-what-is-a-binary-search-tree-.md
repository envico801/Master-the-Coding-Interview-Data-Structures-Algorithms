Q: What is a binary search tree?
A: BSTs excel at preserving relationships, making them suitable for scenarios where maintaining order and structure is important.  
For instance, while a hash table lacks such relationships, organizing folders on a computer necessitates a hierarchical structure with parent and subfolders, which can be achieved using a binary search tree.  
1.In a BST, all child nodes to the right of a root node must have values greater than the current node. This implies that moving to the right within the tree leads to nodes with increasing values, while moving to the left results in nodes with decreasing values.  
2.Due to its nature as a binary tree, each node in a BST can have a maximum of two children.
