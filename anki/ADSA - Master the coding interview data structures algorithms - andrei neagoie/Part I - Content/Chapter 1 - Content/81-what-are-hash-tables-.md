Q: What are Hash Tables?  
A: **Collections of { Key: Value } pairs**  
A Hash table is defined as a data structure used to insert, look up, and remove key-value pairs quickly.  
It operates on the [hashing concept](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-hashing/), where each key is translated by a hash function into a distinct index in an array. The index functions as a storage location for the matching value. In simple words, it maps the keys with the value. (it will store the key and the value at the same address in memory - a "bucket")
