Q: What are the 4 rules of a Red/Black Binary Tree?  
A: 1.Each node must be either Red or Black  
2.Root node must always be black  
3.A red node must always have a black parent node and black child nodes  
4.Every branch path (the path from root node to an empty leaf node \[null\]) must posess the exact same number of black nodes.  
Extras:  
A null leaf node is always considered to be black, even if it is marked red.  
A chain of 3 nodes can never be a valid Red/Black Tree.
