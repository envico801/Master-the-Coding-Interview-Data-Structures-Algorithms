Q: When should you use heap sort?  
A: Heapsort is similar to quicksort and merge sort but has a space complexity of O(1), meaning it uses a constant amount of memory. However, in terms of average performance, heapsort is generally slower than quicksort in most cases.  
Heapsort is recommended only when there is a significant concern about worst-case scenarios and memory usage. In most situations, the text suggests that quicksort or merge sort would be the preferred choices for sorting algorithms.
