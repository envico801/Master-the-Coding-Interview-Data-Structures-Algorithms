Q: What does the rule of "different terms for inputs" mean?  
A: It means that different notations/variables are used for different inputs, because since we do not know the length of each one, we cannot assume that they are the same.  
1.**O(n) is different from O(a + b)**  
2.**O(n^2) is different from O(a \* b)**
