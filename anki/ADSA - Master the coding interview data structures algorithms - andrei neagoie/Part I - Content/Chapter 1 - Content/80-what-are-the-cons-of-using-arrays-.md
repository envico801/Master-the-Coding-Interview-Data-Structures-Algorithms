Q: What are the cons of using arrays?
A: 1.Slow inserts (we have to shift the array when at the very end of the array)
2.Slow deletes (same as inserts)
3.Fixed size\* (sometimes you have to declare the memory ahead of time and how large of an array you want. Most modern languages have dynamic arrays that help with this)
