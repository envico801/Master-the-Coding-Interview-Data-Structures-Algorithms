Q: Sort algorithm question  
Which algorithm would you use for the following context?  
**Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada**  
A: Radix sort / Counting sort / Quick sort  
I would say that our First I would use something like radix or counting sort if the temperatures have no decimal places. If we're saying you know it's -30 to let's say 40 degrees that's a integer number between a small range that can workwell but if I want to sort through data that also has maybe temperatures that are really accurate and have decimal places which you cant do with radix or counting sort then I'm probably going to use quick sort again just so we can do some in memory sorting and hopefully save on that space complexity.
