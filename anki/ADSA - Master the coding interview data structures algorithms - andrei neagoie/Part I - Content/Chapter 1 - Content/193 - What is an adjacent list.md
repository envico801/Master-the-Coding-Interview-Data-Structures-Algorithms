Q: What is an adjacent list?  
A: A collection of vertices and their neighboring vertices which represents a graph.
```javascript
// The index is the node and the value is the nodes neighbors (we can use arrays, objects, linked lists)
// The index in this case is the value of the actual graph node
const graph = [
  [2], // 0
  [2, 3], // 1
  [0, 1, 3], // 2
  [1, 2], // 3
];
```
