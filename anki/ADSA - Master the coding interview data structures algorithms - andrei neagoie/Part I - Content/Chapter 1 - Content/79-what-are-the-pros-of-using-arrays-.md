Q: What are the pros of using arrays?  
A: 1.Fast lookups (accessing information where you know which index you want to look at)  
2.Fast push/pop (adding or removing things at the end of an array)  
3.Ordered (having something that is ordered and close to each other in memory makes it really fast)
