Q: What does it mean when a sorting algorithm is stable?  
A: If a sorting algorithm is stable then it will retain the original order of the data after sorting is completed.  
If there are duplicates of data then the duplicate piece of data that was on the left will remain on the left and the right will remain to the right after sorting is done.
