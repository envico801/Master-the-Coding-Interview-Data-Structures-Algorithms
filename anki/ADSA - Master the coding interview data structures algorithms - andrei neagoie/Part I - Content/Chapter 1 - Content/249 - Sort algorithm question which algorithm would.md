Q: Sort algorithm question  
Which algorithm would you use for the following context?  
**Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random.**  
A: Merge sort / Quick sort  
I'm not really sure I don't have enough information to make a decision here. Maybe I would use merge sort if we have enough memory and memory isn't too expensive on the machine. Or maybe I'll use quicksort if I'm not too worried about worst case and that the user name databases isnt that large Maybe I'll just use quicksort just to save memory space
