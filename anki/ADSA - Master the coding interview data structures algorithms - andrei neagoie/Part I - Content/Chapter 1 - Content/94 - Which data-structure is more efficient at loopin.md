Q: Which data-structure is more efficient at looping over data: An Array or a Hash Table?  
A: An Array.  
If your Hash Table has 50 addresses but only 3 addresses contain Keys, you would still have to access all 50 addresses to obtain those Keys.  
An Array is sequential in memory, which makes it more efficient in this regard.
