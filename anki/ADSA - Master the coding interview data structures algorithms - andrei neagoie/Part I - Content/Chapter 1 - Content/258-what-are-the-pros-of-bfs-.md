Q: What are the pros of BFS?  
A: 1.Shortest path (It's very good for finding the shortest path between a starting point and any other reachable node because we always start off with the root node and then search the closest nodes first and then the nodes further)  
2.Closer nodes (it will look at the closest node first)
