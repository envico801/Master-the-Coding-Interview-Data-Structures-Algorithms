Q: When should you use merge sort?  
A: The main reason is its efficient time complexity of O(n log(n)) in both best and worst case scenarios. If one is concerned about worst case scenarios, merge sort is a suitable choice.  
However, if the goal is to sort data in memory and space complexity is a concern, merge sort can be costly because it requires O(n) space complexity. This means it uses a significant amount of memory.  
On the other hand, if there are large files that cannot be sorted within memory limits, external sorting is required. In this case, merge sort becomes a good option because space complexity matters less. External sorting involves using a process outside of the main memory to sort the data.  
In summary, merge sort is a favorable algorithm due to its efficient time complexity, making it suitable for worst case scenarios. However, if sorting in memory and space complexity is a concern, alternatives may be considered. For external sorting, such as with large files, merge sort is a good choice as space complexity becomes less significant.
