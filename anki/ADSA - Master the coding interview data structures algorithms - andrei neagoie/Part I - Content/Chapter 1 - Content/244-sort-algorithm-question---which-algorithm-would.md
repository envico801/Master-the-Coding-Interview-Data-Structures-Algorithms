Q: Sort algorithm question  
Which algorithm would you use for the following context?  
**eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount**
A: Radix sort / Counting sort  
I would actually use something like radix or counting sort because well a bid is usually a number between let's say $1 to let's say 50000. Probably even less. And because it's a fixed length of integers. Integers are most likely not going to be a hundred million because well hopefully nobody's bidding that much on eBay.
