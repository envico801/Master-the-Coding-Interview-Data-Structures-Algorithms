You've made it through the interviews, and now comes the exciting part: handling job offers and negotiating your salary. This is a skill that can have a massive impact on your career earnings.

### Handling Rejection

First, let's talk about the opposite of an offer. Rejection is a normal part of the process. **Everyone gets rejected.** It doesn't mean you're a bad developer; it just means it wasn't the right fit at that time.

*   **Don't take it personally.**
*   **Ask for feedback.** "Thank you for the opportunity. To help me improve, could you share any feedback from my interview?"
*   **Don't burn bridges.** Ask if it's okay to reapply in the future. The tech world is small.

### Negotiation 101: The Core Principles

Negotiating can be uncomfortable, but it's essential. Most companies expect you to negotiate, and their first offer is rarely their best. A single successful negotiation can be worth tens of thousands of dollars over your career.

1.  **Never Give the First Number:** When an interviewer asks, "What are your salary expectations?" **do not** give a specific number. This is the biggest mistake you can make.
    *   **Bad Answer:** "I'm looking for $90,000." (You may have just cost yourself $10,000 if they were willing to pay $100,000).
    *   **Good Answer:** "Based on my research for a [Your Role] in [Your City], the market rate seems to be around $100,000-$120,000. I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us." (This "anchors" the conversation in your favor without committing you to a single number).

2.  **Give a Reason for Everything:** To avoid sounding greedy, always frame your requests with a reason.
    *   *Instead of:* "I want more money."
    *   *Try:* "Thank you for the offer! This is a big decision for my family, so I'd like some time to discuss it with my partner." (This gives you time to think and gather other offers).

3.  **Always Be Positive and Enthusiastic:** Negotiation is not a battle; it's a collaborative conversation to find a win-win. Stay polite, positive, and express how excited you are about the opportunity. You're not being difficult; you're trying to find a solution that makes everyone happy.

### How to Handle a Job Offer

**Congratulations!** You got an offer. The game is not over; it has just begun.

**Step 1: Express Excitement, but DON'T Accept Immediately.**
"This is fantastic news! I'm very excited about the possibility of joining the team. I am speaking with a few other companies right now, so I'd like to take some time to make a thoughtful decision. When do you need an answer by?"
*   **Key:** You've shown enthusiasm while buying yourself the most valuable asset in a negotiation: **time**.

**Step 2: Create Urgency with Other Companies.**
Now you have leverage! Immediately email every other company you're interviewing with.
*   **Sample Email:** "Hi [Recruiter Name], I'm writing to give you an update. I've just received another offer, but your company is still my top choice. My timeline for a decision is now a bit shorter. Is there any way to expedite our process?"
*   **Why this works:** It provides **social proof** (someone else wants you!) and creates **urgency**. This often accelerates the interview process and can lead to multiple offers.

**Step 3: Prepare Your Counteroffer.**
*   **Research:** Know the market rate for your role and experience level using sites like Glassdoor or Levels.fyi.
*   **Know Your Value:** Be ready to articulate *why* you deserve more, referencing your specific skills and the value you'll bring.
*   **Go Higher:** Ask for slightly more than you actually want, so you have room to meet in the middle.

### Handling Multiple Offers

This is the dream scenario! Now you have maximum leverage. But how do you choose?

Prioritize what's most important to you for your long-term growth.
1.  **Challenge & Growth:** Which job will push you the most and teach you the most? Taking the "harder" job is often the best long-term career move.
2.  **The People:** Will you be working with people who are smarter than you and whom you respect?
3.  **Long-Term Potential:** Which company is on a better trajectory? Where will you be in 5 years?
4.  **Salary & Benefits:** Now you can compare the full packages (salary, bonus, stock options, etc.).
5.  **Happiness:** Which role genuinely excites you the most?

### Getting a Raise in Your Current Job

The principles are the same: you have to ask, and you have to prove your value.
1.  **Keep a "Win" Folder:** Throughout the year, save positive feedback, metrics on projects you've completed, and notes on new skills you've learned.
2.  **Build Your Case:** Create a one-page document that summarizes your accomplishments and the value you've brought to the company since your last review. Show, don't just tell.
3.  **Schedule a Meeting:** Ask for a raise with your evidence in hand. Just like in a new offer negotiation, ask for more than you want to land in a happy middle ground.

Remember, the easiest money you'll ever make is through negotiation. Being prepared and confident can make all the difference.
